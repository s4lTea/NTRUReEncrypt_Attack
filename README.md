# NTRUReEncrypt_Attack
We propose an efficient key recovery attack against NTRUReEncrypt(a PRE scheme), whose parameter sets are related NTRU schemes. For specific scheme on parameter sets ees1087ep1, ees1171ep1, ees1499ep1, where N equals 1087, 1171 and 1499 respectively, our experiments are all completed to recover private keys on PC using SageMath 9.6.

The source code is divided into three modulesï¼š
1. We construct an experimentally used encryption system to collect enough ciphtexts and obtain original keys.
2. We build and solve the system of linear equations on F_2 to obtain re-encryt key rk mod2.
3. We recover rk on Z_q from F_2 to obtain rk modq.

See paper on Indocrypt 2022 for more details.
